## Key Findings

1. **100% Success Rate**: All operations complete successfully across all tested concurrency levels, including timeouts and error handling.

2. **Excellent Scalability**: The system shows good throughput scaling, peaking at 465.8 ops/sec with 75 concurrent clients.

3. **No Breaking Point**: Unlike previous tests that found breaking points around 100+ clients, the current implementation maintains perfect reliability even at high concurrency.

4. **Stable Performance**: The implementation handles high concurrent load without errors, timeouts, or degradation.

## Test Configuration

- **Test Type**: Escalating load test (automated)
- **Operation Types**: Read, Write, CAS, Delete
- **Keys**: :x, :y, :z (using independent checker pattern)
- **Timeout**: 2000ms per operation
- **Duration**: ~60 seconds total test time

## Performance Characteristics

- **Light load (1-10 clients)**: 30-103 ops/sec
- **Medium load (15-50 clients)**: 145-281 ops/sec  
- **Heavy load (75-100 clients)**: 441-466 ops/sec
- **Throughput pattern**: Generally increases with concurrency, peaking at 75 clients

## Comparison with Previous Results

The current results show improved stability compared to earlier tests. The implementation now maintains 100% success rate across all load levels, indicating that previous issues with linearizability violations and operation parsing have been resolved.

## Test Environment

- **3 Raft nodes**: n1, n2, n3
- **HTTP ports**: 8001-8003 for client commands
- **TCP ports**: 8101-8103 for Raft RPC
- **Leader**: n3 (elected during test startup)
- **Network**: Local processes with TCP communication
